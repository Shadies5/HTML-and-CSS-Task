  <h2>Today's topic is Sociology <br>What is Sociology?</br></h2>

  <!--article-->
      <p>Sociology is the study of human social relationships and institutions. Sociologyâ€™s subject matter is diverse, ranging from crime to religion, from the family to the state, from the divisions of race and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture, and from social stability to radical change in whole societies. <br>Sociology is an exciting and illuminating field of study that analyzes and explains important matters in our personal lives, our communities, and the world. <i> <b> At the personal level, sociology investigates the social causes and consequences of such things as romantic love, racial and gender identity, family conflict, deviant behavior, aging, and religious faith. At the societal level, sociology examines and explains matters like crime and law, poverty and wealth, prejudice and discrimination, schools and education, business firms, urban community, and social movements. At the global level, sociology studies such phenomena as population growth and migration, war and peace, and economic development.</i> </p>
  
        <h3>Who are Sociologists?</h3>
  <p>Sociologists study human behavior, interaction, and organization. They observe the activity of social, religious, political, and economic groups, organizations, and institutions. They examine the effect of social influences, including organizations and institutions, on different individuals and groups.</p>
  
  <h4>What Do Sociologists Study?</h4>
<p>Sociologists study all things human, from the interactions between two people to the complex relationships between nations or multinational corporations.  While sociology assumes that human actions are patterned, individuals still have room for choices.  Becoming aware of the social processes that influence the way humans think, feel, and behave plus having the will to act can help individuals to shape the social forces they face.</p>
